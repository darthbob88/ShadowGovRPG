## Moves

Start with any three moves

### Special Weapons Training

You can use any weapon you want, including rocket launchers (4-harm AP reload), heavy machine guns (3-harm area messy), sniper rifles (3-harm far), and grenade launchers (4-harm area), and probably more as GM stats them out.

### One Man Army

Whether through cybernetics, ancient techniques, or some sort of serum, you&#39;ve honed your body as a weapon, to peak human potential, or even more. In a fight, you count as a gang (3-harm small) and have 1-armor at all times.

### Combat Life Saving

You have a well-stocked first aid kit. Once per session, you can stabilize or revive somebody who&#39;s almost dead.

### Shock 'n' Awe

Whenever you do harm, you do +1 harm.

### Better Part of Valor

Name an escape route and roll +Fight. 10+ you were never there, 7-9 you either have to bring something with you or leave something behind at GM&#39;s discretion, 6- you&#39;re a sitting duck.

### Squad Leader

You have a (3-harm small 1-armor) gang of soldiers on your side. When you take this move, choose 1:

* Assault Troops -- +1 armor

* Heavy Weapons -- +1 harm

* Well-Trained -- +disciplined

* Covert -- +stealthy

* Platoon -- Medium instead of small

### Pep Talk

Once per session, when you give a rousing pre-operation speech, roll +PR and take hold; 3 on a 10+, 1 on a 7-9, and +1 even on a miss if the GM feels the player gives a suitably rousing speech. You can spend this hold, 1 for 1, to: let an ally do +1 harm; grant an ally +1 armor; grant an ally +1 on a roll; grant an ally a re-roll.

### On My Mark

Once per session, when you prepare and execute a plan of attack, your teammates can use your Fight stat in place of their own as long as they follow that plan. What constitutes a &quot;prepared plan of attack&quot; is up to the GM, but it should be more complicated than &quot;Open that door, kill everybody in a robe&quot;.
