On a 10+ you cast the spell successfully and without consequences. On a 7-9 you cast the spell, but you a) Attract attention and take a risk, per GM&#39;s suggestion, b) Disturb the fabric of the universe and take -1 to casting any future spells until you prepare your spells again, or c) forget that spell until the next time you prepare your spells.

### Expanded Book

Your spellbook has another spell, and when you prepare spells for the day, you have 4 spells ready to use.

### Cast from the Hip

You can cast any spell in your book, not just the ones you&#39;ve prepared, but you do so at a -1 on the roll.

### Arcane Ward

So long as you have at least one prepared spell, you get +2 armor and can give up one of your prepared spells to completely ignore an attack.

### Magical Shop

You have a magical workspace, per the workspace rules. This is a place of power suitable for **ritual magic**.
