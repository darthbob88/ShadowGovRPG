### All Those Wonderful Toys

You have up to 3 gadgets at any given time. Any time you need to use one of these gadgets to get out of a jam or help the party along, roll +Brains. 10+ works properly, 7-9 has side effects. Machine might break and need to be repaired, might be less precise than desired, might have unusual but non-lethal side effect. Given a solid day of working, you can replace any one of these gadgets.

### Roll up your sleeves

You have a workspace suitable for engineering problems. See **workplace** rules, to be added.

### Yeth, Marthter

You have built an assistant. This might be a research AI, guard-bot, or vat-grown handy homunculus. It provides one of several benefits, to fill in later.

### MacGyver Who?

When you need to quickly build or repair a machine, without proper time/tools/parts, roll +Brains. On a 10+ it works fine. On a 7-9, choose 1: It&#39;ll work for one use/scene; You need to cannibalize one gadget for parts; It works, but at a -2.

### Tool Belt

You&#39;ve got a nifty tool belt, vest made of pockets, or other load-bearing equipment. You can carry +2 gadgets, and get +1 on any rolls that might benefit from a tool belt, most obviously **MacGyver Who?**

### Akashic Record

One of the machines in your workspace, or some combination of them, is uniquely connected to the world. You have access to the **insight** special move. Despite the name, this need not be the Akashic records, it might be an imperfectly calibrated quantum computer, Laplace daemon, or psychic gestalt.

### Fast Mover

You have a jetpack, teleporter, rocket boots, or some other method of fast personal transport. If you need to leave a situation in a hurry, name your escape route and roll +Brains. On a 10+, you might leave footprints or a trail of smoke. On a 7-9, you&#39;re gone, but you either take something with you, or leave something behind, GM&#39;s choice. On a 6-, you&#39;re left in a compromised position until you get out next turn.
