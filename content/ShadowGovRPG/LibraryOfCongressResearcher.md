**Moves**

Start with **Fount of Knowledge** and two other moves

**Fount of Knowledge**

When you use either Forensic Analysis or Thorough Briefing, on a 7-9 you get two
questions/facts instead of one.

**Always Have Answers**

Choose one area of expertise; suggestions include art, history, any of the
sciences, language, literature, or others at GM permission. Within that area,
you cannot be stumped, and on Forensic Analysis or Thorough Briefing, treat a 6-
as a 7-9.

**I’ve Read About This!** or **It’s Just Like An Analogy!**

Once per session, you can use Brains in place of any other stat, either because
you have read books on the subject, or because it’s just like some other
subject, with a few adjustments.

EG: “I have never used a sword, but I have read extensively in Bonetti and Capo
Ferro, so en garde!” or “I slept through evasion and infiltration, but I
remember how cuttlefish flee predators, and can apply those lessons to avoiding
guards here.”

**Not Just Books Down There**

You have a gadget from the Library’s stores, same as the Mad Scientist’s rules
for such.

**Epiphany**

You gain the *insight* special move.

**Word to the Wise**

When somebody acts on your suggestion, as per the Thorough Briefing/Forensic
Analysis move, they get a +2 bonus instead of +1, and you get 1XP.
