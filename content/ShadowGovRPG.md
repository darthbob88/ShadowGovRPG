## Shadow Government: The Redacting

&quot;The Soviets are our _adversary_. Our _enemy_ is the Navy.&quot;

â€” Curtis LeMay, General, US Air Force

Government agencies have to deal with certain unacknowledged threats, like dimensional bullshit, mole men, cryptids, elves, whatever, whilst and simultaneously squabbling with other agencies over budget and prestige, and dickering with HR/management who are reluctant to approve &quot;calling in the 7th Cav&quot; on an expense report, or even understand why they were necessary.

--or--

Imagine if the Men in Black were not such a happy family; yeah, everybody&#39;s working together to make sure America never finds out about the latest vampire uprising or zombie plague or whatever, but they&#39;re also trying to stab each other in the back to get more budget/power/prestige.

--or--

You know how every urban fantasy RPG has a section on the importance of the Masquerade, because if mere mortals ever learn vampires and magic are real it&#39;ll lead to lots of death, chaos, and vampire autopsies? Welcome to the Office of Masquerade Enforcement and/or Vampire Autopsies.

Based off this 4Chan thread: [http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/12743245/](http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/12743245/), particularly post 12743378.

Big rule: If you see a problem, don&#39;t just point it out, correct it. &quot;That group wouldn&#39;t be responsible for that jurisdiction, it&#39;d be some other group or responsibility.&quot;

## Tone

Probably simplest to go with choice of three tones, like Paranoia or Night&#39;s Black Agents.

1. Straight horror, a la Delta Green or SCP. There are monsters out there, you can&#39;t win, all you can do is keep everybody from dying _today_. Focus on the human cost of dealing with monsters, the need to destroy all evidence and witnesses, and the bureaucratic, or possibly literal, knife fights for resources and survival. Characters don&#39;t retire, they just die. <br/>
_Yesterday I watched three of my closest friends, men and women I went through the academy with, die screaming in a raid on a vampire coven. Today I watched a vampire drain a girl dry, because he was kind enough to tell us about that coven. Tomorrow I&#39;ll have to explain to a family that their darling daughter is gone forever, but I can&#39;t tell them why. You want a happy ending? You&#39;re alive to read this, isn&#39;t that happy enough?_
2. Tongue-in-cheek, after the MIB movies and/or the more bureaucratic sections of The Laundry. There are monsters out there, but the worst are the ones in payroll. Focus on the farce of being an ISO 9000 quality-assured occult bureaucracy, of hassling elves to have all their paperwork in order, of trying to discredit your colleagues for the last cut of the budget pie. Characters retire to management, where they can screw over other new agents. <br/>
_Yes, I am aware miss.. Carmella le Rouge? that as a vampire you must dine upon the blood of the living, however we must ask you to stop feeding on homeless people and barflies, as neither you nor the government can afford to publicly acknowledge the existence of vampires. If you can refrain for the next day or two, we can see about getting you set up with an account at a local blood bank, and possibly some other employment._
3. Hijinx/Dept of D&amp;D, like slapstick Paranoia and/or standard dungeon crawl. There are monsters out there, and I&#39;m going to kick them in the face. Focus on the fact that you&#39;re kicking monsters in the face. Characters never retire, they just go on to kick bigger monsters in the face. <br/>
_Butt kicking for goodness!_

## Separate flavor-/gameplay-changing options

These revolve around reducing the level of federal support. The first two are probably supportable out of the box, just by adding an Allegiance field on the character sheet. Possibly two, agency and social group, but that might lead to complicated networks of rep with various agencies.

- Drop the niche-agency connection, so wizard PCs aren&#39;t necessarily part of the BATFE Magical Agents, they could be in any agency&#39;s Magical Section. This will probably change the allegiance/bureaucratic squabbling system slightly, so you&#39;re no longer attached to the BATFE Department of Wizards, you&#39;re just affiliated with the BATFE and thwarting Library of Congress schemes.
- Drop the agency affiliation, changing the bureaucratic war from one between agencies to one between splats; PCs aren&#39;t attached to the BATFE, or any other agency, they&#39;re part of a cross-agency gang of fellow magical types, like Wizard People (Dear Reader) who want library funding so they have more places to store and disseminate their spellbooks, or Dw33bz lobbying for more ~~mad~~ science grants, or Muir&#39;s Marauders who demand a highway divert around a thunderbird nest. This will also probably mean reducing the level of material support, since not even everybody in your actual agency is aware of the Dept of Wizards, or why you need a live black chicken, but on the other hand you should have some pull with your fellow supernatural types.
- Drop the (official) federal support entirely, which will probably require taking the option(s) above as well. FLETC Scholomance is a cadre of self-taught civil servants and academics, the LoC vaults are obscure storage rooms possibly stolen from other agencies, the NRC mad science funds are supply clerks who don&#39;t ask questions about requests for billets of 6061 aluminum and hearts of forsaken children, you get the idea. Again, means reducing the level of material support and concealing activities from the rest of the service, since not even your superiors will necessarily understand why a file is flagged codeword LEGOLAS.

- The magic/supernatural systems are ripe for adjustment.
  - One option that came up while writing this would be adding a (larger) price to magic, requiring a sacrifice of some sort to buy enough magical power; the bad guys are trying to work a large magic, which requires the cliched &quot;sacrificing a virgin beneath a new moon with a holy dagger&quot; business, while the good guys only need to pay a few seconds worth of fatigue/stamina/energy. This is also cool because it means Gatorade is the new mana potion, but the need to track fatigue does not appeal.
  - It&#39;d also be interesting to treat the playbooks as a &quot;specialist&quot; magical system, like _Kraken_&#39;s knacks or Unknown Armies&#39;s thing-mancers; general-purpose witchcraft and wizardry is a rare talent, but lots of people have specialized skills, like one person is master of fire and all its many forms, another can talk to the dead. This could also tie in with the various groups, where people who follow the cult of Hermes Locomotive have knacks relating to trains and rails, HAARP can actually call down lightning, etc.
- I really want to add a corruption/&quot;Gone Rogue&quot; system to represent people turning to the Dark Side. Using forbidden techniques, being a loose cannon, staring too long into the abyss, that sort of thing. It&#39;s hard to handle this, given that you&#39;re already pretty corrupted and rogue compared to even non-Shadow government operatives.
  - You can use a (player-written) Code/Oath for this, in combination with GM-set operational constraints/rules of engagement; every time you do something wrong and break the rules, you have to explain yourself to The GM/Bosses, who may assess punishment as needed, and then you can either accept your demotion or decide to go rogue. This is probably the best option because it allows for the warped moral constraints Shadow Government agents can/will operate under, gives the player significant control over their own downfall, and adds costs other than &quot;GM disapproves but does nothing, until you fall and become the villain of the next campaign&quot;.
- I&#39;m tempted to make the various departments/administrators something like the Icons from 13th Age; you can spend points on having a positive relationship with the NRC, a negative relationship with the CIA&#39;s Deputy Supernatural Liaison Voldemort, an ambiguous relationship with the 7th Cavalry, etc.
  - Maybe dial down the story-guide functionality, since this is supposed to be a mission-based game without a lot of room for &quot;Actually the dice say it was this guy behind it all&quot;, but keep the rest of it. It&#39;ll still work for the requisition stuff, and for determining how minions of the Icons react to you, and for favors.

## Inspiration

- _Crooked_, by Austin Grossman. The true story of Nixon&#39;s Presidency. Weaponizing the Chief Executive through pacts with Things Not Of This World, magical power in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Secret Articles of the Constitution. Not actually inspiration for this game, but it can provide an excellent backdrop and setting for yours, as a crew of PCs join the operation to hunt down Gregor, or one of his crew of ex-Soviet black bag men. Plus, POTUS deciding to ride along on an operation, before taking off his jacket and shirt to reveal the Great Seal ritualistically tattooed on his back, is quite an image.
- _Declare_, by Tim Powers. Another very good book for background. Ten-twenty-thirty years ago, an operation went sideways, and now you have to revisit it for a second trial, when you might even learn why the first attempt failed. You may want to include some of the magic system from this book, with the djinn being creatures of rhythm and external minds, who can be poisoned with the right kind of iron, but I wouldn&#39;t.
- _The Rook_, by Daniel O&#39;Malley. The Queen&#39;s Own X-Men, slaying dragons, crushing antler cults, beating back brigades of Belgian biomodders. Again, not quite inspiration for this game, but a good source of ideas for yours. The Grafters would make pretty cool grand villains, anything less would be good small trash, Camp Caius is exactly the sort of thing a villainous government department might run as a small plot, etc.
- _Kraken_, by China Mieville. The dark truths of London&#39;s Occult Underground. Kinda inspirational, since PCs are basically the FSRC, but roughly every character or concept would make a brilliant addition to your game. A crime boss who&#39;s just a soul bound into a sentient and angry tattoo? A transporter who&#39;s based his aesthetic on Star Trek? Angelic defenders of memory and museums? A cult of seers who read the bones of their city? A magical union organizer, who can only materialize by inhabiting statues? Please and thank you.
- _Delta Green_ by Adam Scott Glancy, Dennis Detwiller, and John Tynes. This game is somewhere between inspired by and ripped off from Delta Green. It&#39;s also about a secret group within the government protecting America and the world from unwholesome monsters. The main advantages for this game are the broader setting, since DG is exclusively Cthulhu Mythos, and the PBTA system as opposed to DG&#39;s BRP. You could probably do a lot worse than to spend a few hours manhandling this game into Apocalypse Green.
- _The Laundry_ books and RPG by Charles Stross. Similar story to above; secret group within the government fights Cthulhoid monsters and tries to keep the public from finding out. The main difference is that the Laundry is a more legitimate, if obscure government agency as opposed to DG&#39;s conspiracy concealed from even the Feds, and like this game, bureaucracy is an obstacle to the hero&#39;s activities only slightly less harrowing than the monsters.
- _X-Files_ by Chris Carter. TV show about two government agents investigating paranormal activity, and occasionally a dark conspiracy within the government. Somewhat inspirational, to the point where you can easily turn this into X-Files: The Game, but mostly useful for tone-setting and NPC generation. The Monster of the Week episodes would be good low-level plots, and the Conspiracy might make a decent higher-level story.
- _Warehouse 13_ by Jane Espenson. Again, government agents track down strange objects and dark conspiracy. Slightly inspirational, mostly as a source of interesting artifacts, but some of the characters are cool enough, Myka&#39;s basically a Librarian already, and Mrs Frederic would make a marvelous boss for the PCs.
- _The Librarians_ by Dean Devlin and Noah Wyle. Agents of a non-government organization go out to retrieve ancient artifacts and writings, and occasionally save the day from fiendish plots. As you can probably guess from the name, inspirational for the librarians class, but mostly good as a source of artifacts and plots to rip off.

## Explanations

Why does the government want to keep everything secret? Suppressing jetpack invention, keeping vampires hidden, breaking up cults, etc? Why hasn&#39;t DARPA started mass-producing plasma rifles and powered armor for our troops, why do characters still have to pay so much for them? Assuming you can&#39;t just take &quot;It&#39;s part of the game premise&quot; as an answer, here are a few options:

**Why the secrets? Why the need for Plausible Deniability?**

**The world is not ready for the truth** , in one way or another. Magic and super-science and such are more power than people can be reasonably trusted with; tens of thousands of Americans are killed each year by guns and cars, can you imagine the carnage if they had fireballs or jetpacks? Likewise, while nuclear proliferation is a massive threat to global stability, there are surprisingly simple rituals and superscience that give small countries or large terrorist groups the power to destroy all life on this planet. The situation with spooky creatures isn&#39;t much better; while some vampires might actually be good and can be worked with, for the most part the general public will assume everybody with pale skin and dark clothes is a horrible predator and needs to die. That last is the real reason, what it all comes down to; if people find out that magic and superscience and vampires and elves are all real, and their government has been hiding the truth, there will be panic, riots in the streets, it will not end well, and so you must ensure that the people never discover this lie.

Granted, you/your players may or may not agree with this assessment, and may put some effort into making people ready. Some Silicon Valley startups are crewed with mad scientists leaking technology to the public at a controlled pace, some research labs have a mage on staff nudging them to the places where even quantum physics starts to break down, and the State Department has plans on file for making &quot;official&quot; First Contact with extraterrestrial life some time in the next 30-50 years. Any minor failures to maintain Plausible Deniability can be turned to hasten public acceptance. The truth will come out soon, and you will be prepared.

Alternatively, especially if you&#39;re playing in full Bleak mode, you may want to intensify some of those arguments. NIH case files include a grant recipient who actually created a reliable cure for most forms of cancer. Unfortunately, she was killed resisting arrest when it emerged that her cure required the heart of a cocaine-addicted child to produce. The deep vaults in the Library of Congress include a near-perpetual motion machine, which could eliminate reliance on fossil fuels, were it not designed to run on the conversion of unbearable torment to heat. We can fulfill all of your noblest dreams, here in the shadow government, but are you willing to pay the cost?

**What makes a threat?**

- Your own opinion, of course. You may be prepared to let vampires be, because they&#39;re people too. You may decide that sasquatch have to die, because they&#39;re unnaturally hairy. It&#39;s all up to you and your players.
- Are they a threat in mundane ways? While you can probably accept supernatural types as citizens with rights, a vampire selling their blood as a cool new drug is still illegal, as is a mad scientist grabbing test subjects off the street. This can also lead to interesting discussions of how the supernatural interacts with mundane law; is a contract signed while one party is under the effect of a mind control spell valid?
- Are they going to break Plausible Deniability? Even if they&#39;re perfectly friendly and legal, a mad scientist advertising in the classifieds for test subjects, or a wizard summoning angels to do his shopping, might draw more attention than we can afford.
- Are they threatening to alter the status quo in an unacceptable manner/to an unacceptable degree? This is another one that&#39;s particularly dependent on opinion, because some groups might be more willing than others to accept the idea of a leftist activist using Woodie Guthrie&#39;s guitar to send us into a thousand years of liberal darkness, or a vampire campaigning to increase funding for blood banks so he can make withdrawals.

**Who&#39;s involved in this?**

Obviously, this depends on what sort of game you&#39;re playing, but personally, here&#39;s my rough outline.

1. Civilian watchers and friendlies, around 200K, possibly up to a million. Not very clued-in, not very potent, but absolutely necessary as the first line of warning. This ranges from people who know that there are monsters and aliens and want to help deal with them, to mayors and police chiefs who neither know nor care about the wilder world, but just know that if things get too weird, there&#39;s a number they can call to make it all go away. Quite frequently blend in with the latter two categories as well, with amateurs perusing Fortean &#39;zines for the real thing and garage tinkerers putting together vampire detectors.
2. Analysts, around 20K. Official watchers, on constant vigil for things you need to investigate. Some of them are brainiacs who read reams of reports and newspapers every day, some are seers reading the futures, and at least one is a greybeard from Accounting whose knee goes funny when trouble&#39;s coming.
3. Logistical support, around 30K. The people who make all your wonderful toys and think up new ones. Includes alchemists, enchanters, weaponsmiths, gadgeteers, and the occasional lady who just likes explosions too much.
4. Field operatives, like yourselves, around 15K. The people who go out and save the day, thwarting cults, protecting visiting dignitaries, retrieving items of power. The tip of the spear, the probe of justice rooting out evil, the light illuminating darkness, whatever metaphor you prefer.
5. Administration, possibly as high as 10K. Your bosses. Might be mere bureaucrats who point you at problems and deny expense reports, might be scary operators intriguing and politicking at levels well over your head. Will usually have secondary secret objectives for you, like recovering a cult&#39;s grimoire for their purposes, silencing a certain criminal before they can reveal their Federal patrons, or just bringing back video of your PC Sergeant Slaughter fist-fighting a werewolf.

Obviously, if the game you&#39;re running assumes a smaller conspiracy, you can reduce all of those numbers by a factor of 2 to 100. But of course, all this is irrelevant save as backdrop, because as far as your players are concerned, they&#39;ll only see 3 or 4 dozen people, perhaps 8 of whom will have names.

**Why aren't these things being produced and issued _en masse_ ?**

Your choice of several.

- Mass production is too expensive. Each of the Army&#39;s monster-slayer bullets costs about $30 just for the silver, never mind 90nm-engraving the runes of banishment or inserting the small sliver of rowan wood.
- It needs a human touch. As much as DARPA/NRC have tried, machine-assembled plasma rifles aren&#39;t as good as those hand-made by their engineers.
- It needs a human touch _and_ expensive materials. The Hand of Glory requires a hand from a murderer executed by hanging, which is then treated over several weeks with certain complicated sigils and solutions. Given that very few states still hang people, this does rather limit production.
- As noted above, proliferation is a serious concern. If hostile groups were able to reverse-engineer a laser rifle, it would give them a substantial advantage.
- Good old monopolistic rent-seeking. At present, if you want a pistol enchanted for concealability, you need to pay BATFEM through the nose, and they see no reason to change this state of affairs.

## Mechanics

The basic mechanic is Powered by The Apocalypse, with some hacking. That means for any given action, you declare what move you're going to use, then roll 2 six-sided dice and add the relevant skill. If the dice + your skill sum to 6 or less, you fail, if they sum to 7-9, you succeed partially, and if they sum to 10+ you succeed entirely.

Stats:

- **Fight** - For pretty much any violent stuff you need to do. If you're shooting, punching, stabbing, or calling in an artillery strike on something, this is the stat to use.
- **Public Relations** - Charm and persuasion. If you're telling somebody that all they saw was some swamp gas, or asking the FBI station chief to lend you a forensic team to analyze a scene, this is the stat to use.
- **Brains** - This is your "knowing stuff" stat, covering both pre-existing knowledge and analysis. If you need to know what a Rigellian's favorite food is, or what left some tracks, this is the stat to use.
- **Covert** - Sneaky stuff. If you need to hack into somebody's servers, impersonate somebody, or sneak into a location, this is the stat to use.

## General moves and Stats

**Requisition assistance** : The gimmicky feature. Call on some resource, either backup and manpower ranging from another dozen analysts to SWAT to the 7th Cav, or a service, like getting the NRO to retask scryers for your operation, NASA to teleport you to the Moon, or a friendly hacker to pull a piece of information from the ether. Ties in with the below, but is marginally quicker and less explicit about payment. Requisition represents both a heavily abstracted dollar budget, and the informal economy of favors, debts, and blackmail. Spend up to 3 requisition, then roll +Spent req.

10+ You get exactly what you want, within a few days, and at no additional cost.

7-9 You get it, but (any or all of)

- It&#39;ll take extra time, from several days to a month.
- It&#39;ll cost you extra, either 1-req or an in-character favor
- It&#39;s compromised either in quantity or functionality; you only get one set of NVGs, or an older generation.

6- Either you don&#39;t get it, or all of the above.

_**Optional**_: Additional costs or discounts, depending on how (in)convenient the actual request is, possibly including PC connections/rep with other agencies. This is to avoid &quot;For the same 1-req cost I can get a really cool gun, _or_ I can call in an armored division plus air support&quot;, and to represent PCs having history and friends/enemies with one department or another. Might also do &quot;stunting&quot;, for +1 Req if you can explain what you&#39;re offering and/or who is your contact, but that&#39;s always a little controversial.

**Public Relations** : General diplomacy/parley/bullshit. Roll +Persuade to get somebody to do/believe what you want. On a 7+ they&#39;ll do it, but they (may) want a favor, 7-9 they want some immediate assurance you can follow through on that favor. Mind, this is only really necessary for big favors, where &quot;You have the gratitude of the nation&quot; or &quot;Uncle Sam says that was just swamp gas&quot; isn&#39;t enough.

**Conflict Resolution** : General combat. Again, nothing special. Might cover shooting and also stabbing. Same kinda move(s) as Dungeon and Apocalypse World; roll +Fight, then you might either move to get a good shot, take a poor shot, or have to reload.

**Thorough Briefing** and **Forensic Analysis** : Intellectual moves, covering both knowing relevant facts and understanding a situation/person, more or less like AW/DW. Roll +Brains, and you get either a good/vague/no answer, or the answer to three/one/no questions from the list.

NB: Between smartphones, internet, and dedicated analysts, simple enough questions can be answered immediately and complex questions can be answered quickly, and with (commandeered) CSI techs and analysts, you can learn everything about a location or person. That&#39;s a problem of time and cost, though.

**Covert Infiltration** : What it says on the tin. Mostly for non-violent infiltration; hacking through firewalls, sneaking past guards, infiltration under false credentials, probably a few others. Special case of information-gathering and combat preparation. Not all complications will be suitable for all actions. Have to abort early, have to move slowly, are detected/caught.

**Act Under Fire** : Probably best to copy from DW; each stat can be used for general &quot;I&#39;m doing a thing under pressure, even though there are no rules for it&quot; actions.

10+ You do it.

7-9 You do it, but it&#39;s not all gone your way.

6- You don&#39;t do it.

**Apply Condition** : Equal parts stolen from Monsterhearts and FATE. Not its own action, but a side effect of other actions. Conflict Resolution can leave a target &quot;Suppressed&quot; and more vulnerable to getting shot, or Thorough Briefing can reveal a &quot;Vulnerable to Silver&quot; condition on werewolves. When you leverage the condition in a move and also in-character, you get a +1 on that roll.

====================================================================

## Classes/Player Options

Maybe a dozen departments, each with their own area of expertise (dimensional bullshit, creatures from beneath the surface, aliens, ghosts) and/or legally protected jurisdiction (schools and libraries, national parks, waterways). Possibly also a source of income on the side; river tolls used to pay for maintenance and dredging, but now they pay to keep the kappa and kraken down. Players should be field operatives; CIA cleaner, DoEd inquisitor, Library of Congress action scientist, whatever, so long as they don&#39;t just sit in their office in DC. Can probably draw on the Laundry RPG for some inspiration here, and maybe elsewhere. Beware redundancy: Don&#39;t want to get too many options, lest we duplicate problems.

Limitation and balance for supernatural stuff, stolen from Dresden Files: it can only a) do the same kind of thing as fighting, either damage, defense, or maneuver, b) accomplish tasks a mere mortal could with time and resources, c) answer otherwise impossible questions, or d) interact with supernatural stuff. Basically it can be a gun or a handy-dandy thing-inator, but not an obstacle- and challenge-removing IWIN button.

**Additional note from the creator** : The generalist classes, mostly the mad scientist and mage at this writing, need to be heavily limited in the interests of niche protection for the other classes. If a madman with a plasma caster can fight as well as the hardened soldier, the lady playing the soldier doesn&#39;t get any chance to shine as _the_ fighting woman. Covert infiltration is a chance for the lady playing the CIA to show her skill, _unless_ a wizard upstages her by using invisibility to sneak even better.

### NRC Mad Scientist (Artificer/Gadgeteer)

FLAVOR: After taking down the swarm of atomic madmen that popped up in the 50s and 60s, the Atomic Energy Commission and its successor the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have taken over mad science as a whole. If it involves somebody cackling madly as they throw a knife switch while thunder rolls in the background, the NRC is on the case. Of course, half the time they come bearing job offers; the NRC doesn&#39;t really want to stop mad scientists, they just want to keep them quiet and preferably not invading Toledo. NASA always needs more people willing to shoot for the Moon, DARPA can never have enough people building things that go boom, but a lot of them stay with NRC, where they have moderately free reign to indulge their craft.

CONFLICTS: Just about everybody, usually because of what the madboy was working on; NRC says genetically-modified killer cucumbers are clearly mad science, while the USDA says it&#39;s food from which they need to save Americans.

GROUPS: NRC and/or Dw33bz

MECHANICAL BONUS/SCHTICK: Mad engineering; you want rayguns, you want hoverboards, you want a machine that goes ping, they can hook you up. Possibly also machine empathy, or some other technology-related advantages. Not sure whether they or the Librarians should be masters of hacking.

### IRS Necromancer

FLAVOR: Because only two things in life are certain, and they already regulate one of them. Exceedingly useful in settling probate cases, and collecting back taxes owed by the dead. Some jurisdiction over the dead and zombies, mostly putting down the restless dead. Nobody much likes them, being as they are taxmen and necromancers, but nobody ever makes trouble for them either, being as they are taxmen and necromancers.

CONFLICTS: Most groups; due to the location/circumstances/profession of the dead. Friction with the Smithsonian, as they call up the spirits of dead Americans while the IRS tries to lay them to rest.

GROUPS: IRS and/or Deadmen.

MECHANICAL BONUS: Interaction and communication with spirits; murder victims, restless ghosts, disturbed spirits. Possibly raising zombies at high levels, or ghostly familiars to order around. Vampiric touch, playing with life forces, and something around easing/blocking passage, either last rites or brief stabilization, possibly by playing with life force.

### NPS ranger (Ranger, tracker, outdoorsy type)

The US is covered by about 131,200 square miles of national parks, preserves, and historic sites, plus another 297,000 of national forest and grassland. And every last mile is home to interesting monsters that the mundanes can&#39;t handle, from the thunderbirds nesting in Yellowstone, to the Sasquatch stalking through Gifford Pinchot, to the ghostly brigades still charging across Gettysburg Park. Despite the chapter header, the responsibility is actually shared between the National Park Service, Forest Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service in a gentleman&#39;s agreement that varies from active support and backup to simply ignoring jurisdictional conflict. Fortunately for all involved, the job is mostly watching and tracking the beasties so they can mark certain areas as off-limits for some plausible reason. Like last year, when they shut down Devil&#39;s Tower for &quot;trail maintenance&quot;. That was an alien landing, NPS had to run interference while State diplomats had Rigellian ale with little grey men. On the other hand, sometimes things go south, like a few years ago up in Glacier park when a wendigo ate three campers, and when that happens there&#39;s nobody better at finding these critters, with the possible exception and competition of INS hunters and NRO eyes-in-the-sky.

CONFLICTS: Friction with the diplomatic arms, who like using their parks for discreet conferences. Clashes with BIA and INS/NASA over certain entities living in the park system.

GROUPS: NPS/USFS/FWS and/or Muir&#39;s Marauders.

MECHANICAL BONUS: Bonuses to nature/survival skills, finding/tracking targets, understanding and connection with animals, if not to Dr Doolittle extent. Maybe familiar, combat pet?

### Library of Congress Researcher (Field Brainiac)

There&#39;s a secret vault beneath the LOC, several vaults even, going down a few levels and spreading out a mile or two under the city. Therein lie various artifacts deemed too dangerous for modern society, like the death ray Tesla built at Wardenclyffe, Ben Franklin&#39;s lightning-spraying key, and an ever-full pot of stew recovered from a miner&#39;s camp. They can&#39;t all be winners. But more importantly, those vaults contain the actual Library, all the significant supranormal literature; designs for the death ray Tesla built as well as all the ones he thought were too dangerous, Houdini&#39;s real book of tricks, and a treaty signed with Elvis&#39;s actual homeworld. Of course, these archives must be continuously expanded, there are new things to learn, new artifacts to retrieve, secret writings to retrieve and sequester. For this reason, less than half of the library&#39;s staff actually stays in the library, poring over old books for hidden knowledge or uncovering new secrets of ancient artifacts, while the rest are out there in the world seeking new things.

CONFLICT: Minimal; while the Library can probably claim jurisdiction on any case that involves Things Man Was Not Meant To Know or retrieving old books for their archives, for the most part they&#39;re willing and welcome to just ride along on other department operations. Occasional strain due to their requests that other agencies recover live samples and intact arcane texts.

GROUPS: Library of Congress and/or Eggheads.

MECHANICAL BONUS: They know things. Either they can answer a question immediately, or with a few minutes of searching, they can answer most questions, though it&#39;s limited to anything that might reasonably be in a library; they have a few grimoires and bestiaries, so they know about most of the things that go bump in the night, but they can still be surprised, and they may not have certain national secrets. They can also get an artifact, possibly, under more or less the same rules and restrictions as any other supernatural material.

### 10th Mountain veteran (Muscle, Fighter but useful)

Unlike most of the other options here, the 10th Mountain division weren&#39;t founded to fight things that go bump in the night, nor were they retasked, they just kinda took it upon themselves to be the people that thump the things that go bump in the night. So here&#39;s the story: During WWII, the brave fighting men of 10th Mountain discovered that there were scarier things than Germans in Italy. Granted, they weren&#39;t alone in this, but they were the ones who stepped up to the task and earned recognition by Supreme Allied Command as the people to call when faced with unusual opposition. They were the ones who stormed Cachtice Castle and dealt with a coven of vampires that had been preying on Allied forces, and the ones who routed and captured the magicians of the Thule Society along with their writings. Ever since, they have maintained a brigade of soldiers who know how to fight monsters and madmen, and they&#39;re occasionally seconded to more &quot;normal&quot; government task forces that require more firepower than a bunch of civil service types can usually bring to bear.

Flavor note: If you don&#39;t like the 10th Mountain Division as much as I do, feel free to change it to a similarly elite unit, though I&#39;d advise against SEALs or Green Berets. The other options are something resembling regular civil servants, so this should be something resembling a regular soldier. Airborne or light infantry is probably a good idea, or whichever unit you served with, or whatever group is based nearby. Also, never mind federal policy, if a woman says she wants to thump monsters with the lads, she damn well thumps monsters with the lads.

CONFLICTS: No real jurisdiction, but certain groups disapprove of their fondness for overwhelming force and total destruction, or their brigadier&#39;s process for answering support requests based on the quality of the whiskey that comes with them.

GROUPS: Army. Not sure there&#39;s any better social group for them; maybe something revolving around being monster slayers?

MECHANICAL BONUS: Access to bigger guns than anybody else, better at using them effectively. Possibly general combat skills; sneakier, shootier, stabbier than most people.

### ATF Combat Wizard (Wizard)

As much time as they spend knocking down cults, it&#39;s only natural that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms would take an interest in magic. They don&#39;t do much with the esoteric book-delving, though they follow rare book sales nearly as obsessively as the Library. Most junior and field agents just focus on the combat and utility magic that&#39;s relevant to law enforcement, blasting away with fireballs and acid bolts, but some agents choose to apply their skill with finesse and subtlety. Actually, the R&amp;D group at FLETC Scholomance is world-class, having created many new spells and refinements to the old; they&#39;ve managed to tighten and control the classic fireball for use as a grenade, tight-beam laser, or on-demand welding torch, and the rite for summoning spirits of death can now be accomplished with nothing more than a fresh egg and a few cc&#39;s of mouse blood.

CONFLICTS: Some friction with the Library of Congress, regarding magic and forces from Beyond the Veil. Other conflict with NRC over whether or not laser rifles fall under Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and/or Explosives.

GROUPS: BATFEM, and/or Wizard People.

MECHANICAL BONUS: (Better) Magic, comprising additional training/moves and/or additional power.

### FDA Alchemist (Versatile buffer)

Technically it&#39;s the Food, Drug, and Potion Administration, but it&#39;s too late to change the stationery. Too tired to come up with anything interesting, but they have more or less the same gimmick as the NRC, so I might just fold potions/mad chemistry in with their mad engineering, or just list the FDA as another support resource that&#39;s always open to ~~test subjects~~ customers.

### BIA Gambler(Probability magic)

Not actually connected to Natives,this power set mostly comes from the connection between native casinos and state Gaming Commissions. They still handle Native Americans, and are occasionally lent to Gaming Commissions to catch especially good cheaters, but their main area is non-human natives, like forest/river/wind spirits, or that colony of elves living in upstate New York. Really, anything that was born here, isn&#39;t human, and is intelligent enough to tell NPS to go away falls into the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Naturally this causes a certain amount of friction with NPS and INS over who handles sasquatch or extradimensional entities.

MECHANICAL BONUS: Rerolls, lots of them. Whatever other probability voodoo we can think of. Probably give them a resource of their own, Favor of Lady Luck or something, gained when failing action, spent to improve rolls.

### CIA Cleaner (Sneaky stuff)

Oh lordy. You saw that opening quote, about enemy vs adversary? Cults, supramundane creatures, mad scientists, those are your adversaries, but the CIA is your _enemy_. They&#39;re rumoured, although never proven, to be connected to just about every supranatural conspiracy in the country. MJ12, supposedly, was a CIA operation investigating the Roswell incident which since has grown to hundreds of people determined to save our planet from inhuman monsters. Initiative Montauk was a CIA-led/DoD-funded attempt to develop psychic powers that succeeded, disappeared, and occasionally surfaces again in search of some mysterious goal which nobody understands, but which somehow requires a lot of death and chaos. And then there are the innumerable little cults that spring up and get used as catspaws by the Agency or other unscrupulous players, searching for some lost item of power or testing some new weapon. They&#39;ve got skeletons in their closet, is what I&#39;m saying. On the other hand, this makes them very useful. Nobody can lie, sneak, or stab their way through security as well as an Agency cleaner, and they&#39;re generally pretty experienced at covering up shenanigans from the mundanes. Just a shame they&#39;re so good at lying to and backstabbing their colleagues as well. The CIA don&#39;t have any real jurisdiction, and are actually forbidden from operating in the United States, but that&#39;s never stopped them before.

MECHANICAL BONUS: Bonus on rolls to conceal the truth; social face and/or covert infiltrator. Combined Parker/Sophie from Leverage, or thief/rogue from DnD.

### NASA/ICE Xenophile (Aliens)

Not a formal cooperation, but as the people who deal with aliens, they&#39;ve coalesced into a joint interagency group, albeit a schizoid one. NASA&#39;s side is full of people who grew up on Star Trek, who want nothing more than to seek out new life and new civilizations, that we might learn from each other in peaceful communication, especially if they happen to be green-skinned space babes who know not this thing called &quot;love&quot;. ICE, on the other hand, deals mostly with scummier aliens, asylum-seeking refugees, criminals on the run, minor cons trying to make a living without a Social Security number, you get the idea, and as a result they tend to be slightly more cynical in their dealings with ETs. Some jurisdictional friction with the other super-science divisions, since it can be hard to tell a madman-made laser rifle from an alien-made one, and there&#39;s always a certain amount of conflict between ICE and NASA over dominance, but for the most part they get on adequately with other agencies.

MECHANICAL BONUS: Alien widget(s), as the NRC Mad Scientist. Interaction with and understanding of extraterrestrials.

### Smithsonian Shaman (Shaman/Stance)

The Smithsonian are the other group with a shitload of old magical stuff, and they&#39;ve learned to use that to channel the spirits/archetypes of notable Americans to their advantage. Some conflict with the LoC, as the other group with an interest in magical artifacts; the IRS as the other group who cares about the spirits of America; still resentful of the NPS getting jurisdiction over National Historic Places; otherwise aloof.

MECHANICAL BONUS: Can use old spirits for either stances (Ridden by Audie Murphy: +2 Fighting), moves (Nixon&#39;s Tongue: +2 on any attempts to lie) or both (Nixon&#39;s Tongue can only be used by somebody already channeling Nixon). Should probably also have some &quot;Must stay in character&quot; taboo, that if violated breaks the connection. See also Unknown Armies and Iconomancy/Avatars.

Possibilities: Audie Murphy(Fighting), Jim Bowie(Fighting), Ben Franklin(Brains), Richard Feynman(Brains), Walter Cronkite(Persuade), Richard Nixon(Persuade), John Birch(Covert), J Edgar Hoover(Covert), Wild Bill Donovan(Covert).

=====================================================================

## Equipment

Various species of gun and body armor, obviously. A few aids for either magic or madness, like wand or slide rule, or can accept those as always-carried equipment. Some first aid, like health potions or antivenin. Some generally useful kit, like magic-tracers or ID kits for various creatures. Can probably steal a few ideas from Shadowrun or Eberron.

Magically improved kit- Can be had, but custom job; must specifically haggle with department responsible.

Guns- Pistol, rifle, maybe shotgun and sniper. Not much use apart from tags and situational +1 bonus.

Armor- Might need to research for realism, but most likely light 1-armor that can go under a heavy shirt, 2-armor with chicken plates, up to probably 3- or 4-armor juggernaut suits.

Wand/Orb/Slide Rule- Implement for supernatural talent. Not sure if necessary, bonus, or purely flavorful. Can be used as melee weapon either way.

Spotter Deck- Maybe just for flavor, may add +1 on Thorough Briefing checks to identify a creature/phenomenon, but dammit I want a deck of cards showing Bigfoot silhouettes. May not be a deck of cards, might be something like Tobin&#39;s Spirit Guide.

## Artifacts

Unique cool items; vary in potency from flavor/utility to campaign-level objectives for suppression/destruction/use, and source from technology that could/should not be replicated to semi-magical items imbued with power by association with their owners/zeitgeist/other context. Can probably steal liberally from Warehouse 13 or some of the less horrifying SCPs. Must be physical item, although a phonograph record containing the ultimate melody would probably count.

- Stew Pot from Coloma, CA - From a miner&#39;s settlement in the area in 1853, produces nigh-endless beef stew when placed over a fire and partly filled with water and organic material. Stew is filling, but crude and obviously not vegan. Obviates any need for rations in the wilderness, less advantageous in urban environs, though would be boon for soup kitchens and the like.

- Paladin&#39;s Pistol- The Library has in storage many &quot;guns that never miss&quot;, including Lee Harvey Oswald&#39;s magic bullets, Andrew Jackson&#39;s duelling pistols, and Winchester #10,000, but Paladin&#39;s Pistol is probably the mildest of them. It &quot;only&quot; guarantees you will hit what you&#39;re aiming at (+1 on Shooting, or if you spend an action taking aim you get an automatic 10+), and its only downside is that it&#39;s a six-shooter in an uncommon caliber.

- Lee Harvey Oswald&#39;s Magic Bullet(s)- Yes, conspiracy theorists, there *was* only one shooter, and that bullet *was* magic. Originally made in a clip of 6, of which 5 remain, these bullets will adjust to fit whatever caliber and gun you need, and will kill anybody you shoot them at. Cover is no obstacle, dodging is useless, you shoot, they die, end of discussion. Unfortunately, these bullets are cursed, marking the shooter as well for imminent death. Depending on the target, giving your life to take theirs might be a worthwhile trade, but on the other hand, there are only 5 such cartridges and we can&#39;t/won&#39;t make more.

- Woody Guthrie&#39;s guitar, the original &quot;This machine&quot;- If played properly, either as part of the right ritual or just by somebody who means it, the song will come true and &quot;All you fascists bound to lose&quot;. Or &quot;This land is your land, this land is my land&quot;, or &quot;This train is bound for glory&quot;, or even &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;, at GM&#39;s decision. May also be used as actual weapon only effective against right-wing or totalitarian entities, because &quot;This Machine Kills Fascists&quot;. Similar story with Pete Seeger&#39;s banjo, Bob Dylan&#39;s harmonica, any other instrument the GM likes.

- Joe McCarthy&#39;s Original List- As above; either ritual or serious belief will lead to another Red Scare, or possibly some similar witch hunt aimed at other marginalized group/threat. It can also be used as an anti-Communist Death Note; write a name on the list, and they'll (eventually) be blacklisted as politically unreliable.

=====================================================================

## Plot

Best answer to justify unit cohesion with a group of mutually distrusting departments is that they&#39;re part of an interim objective joint ad hoc task force, to handle either some specific and immediate threat (death cult collaborating with ghouls and ghosts) or jurisdiction (crazy things happening in the Southwest), after which they (might) go their separate ways. Single-problem task force is probably best answer; also lends itself to interesting names for campaigns, either quasi-badass and appropriate like OPERATION DIOCLETIAN to root out cults, or less awesome, like Task Force Marshmallow.

Note to self: Look up actual codeword generation and operation naming, like [https://cxxr.github.io/nsa.js/](https://cxxr.github.io/nsa.js/)

### Basic Plot

Unfortunately for sandbox-lovers, a game like this requires a certain amount of structure; characters are part of a task force and deployed to deal with a certain problem. On the other hand, there are options for what that problem comprises and how they solve it, from diplomatic security to counterintelligence to witchfinding to treasure hunting, and from extravagant badge-flashing to discretion and infiltration.

The basic structure is simple:

1. **The Lead**
The government finds something unusual. This might be a Senator&#39;s kid found dead with ritualistic wounds, an uptick in Sasquatch sightings, rumors of a superhero, or just &quot;The analysts have a funny feeling about this&quot;.
1. **The Clues**
The Senator&#39;s kid was near saltwater before they died; maybe something happened down in the sea caves? The local PD probably has something about that spandex weirdo, or just any other unusual happenings. Or if not them, you might know somebody spooky that you can lean on.
1. **The Hurdle**
Turns out that something did happen by the sea caves, it&#39;s still happening in fact, and they really don&#39;t want to be interrupted. The police do know something useful, but they&#39;re reluctant to share it with Feds from out of town.
This may lead back into step 2; the cultists that attack the party have octopus tattoos on their arm, obviously they're part of Krakenkirche!
1. **Climactic Confrontation**
Wrangle a dozen more bodies to join the assault on the sea caves, leading up to an epic fight with the many-armed high priest. Turns out the new superhero is a police officer, and you need to talk them down before they murder the corrupt mayor.

This is suitable for a single episodic plot; if you want to make a longer plot, it&#39;s easy enough to chain step 1 from 4; after examining the cult&#39;s effects, it appears they were backed by another established group, possibly Montauk, possibly another cult, possibly a rogue Fed, but whoever it is, you have a name to track down. It&#39;s also fundamentally reactive, with the party investigating an existing problem, but it&#39;s easy enough to make it more proactive, with the party searching for problems to solve, or possibly setting out to create their own problems.

Big Bads

Cults and Conspiracies: Differ mainly in leadership, purpose, and scale. Cults tend to be smaller groups, maybe a few dozen, maybe a hundred, and largely seek power and wealth through service to a higher power. This might be sacrifices to gain the patronage of dark powers, or a gang doing jobs in service of a charismatic leader. Things like Esoteric Order of Dagon, or Hyde Club (Tyler Durden discovers Hyde formula), or a corporate figure with ties to either. Straddling the line between conspiracy and cult are pod people, infiltrating organizations for their own ends; this might be precursor to invasion, or aggressive lobbying by Big Industry-Of-Your-Choice.

Conspiracies tend to be larger, and serve a more complicated Cause than most cults, though still generally boiling down to power and wealth. SKYNET/Automated Call Center #1249K manipulates industry to its own hyperlogical computerized ends, and HAARP manipulates weather/minds to profit somehow.

Can probably draw a few examples from Laundry/CoC/DG for dark gods, gangs and new age stuff for leaders, and 40K genestealers for pod people.

## Example Threats

Best way to structure a threat is probably to steal from [Night&#39;s Black Agents](http://projects.inklesspen.com/fatal-and-friends/professorprof/nights-black-agents/#14) and the Conspyramid; threats have street-level thugs, who report to city-level bosses, who report to state managers, who report to national/regional heads, and so on up to Mr Big.

**Warning Sidebar**: Somebody's probably going to ask what makes a villain, or more specifically, a not-villain. To a very large extent, the answer is &quot;Your own opinion&quot;, but otherwise the simplest test is &quot;Apart from their supernatural shenanigans, are they doing anything else illegal, or otherwise harmful to the United States, its government, or its citizens?&quot; Mormons may want to bring everybody into their church, and their door-to-door proselytizing is annoying, but if you refuse to convert they'll let you be, rather than offering you as a sacrifice to the Angel Moroni. A Frankenstein seeking to reverse death is questionable, especially depending on where their test subjects are coming from, but not actually illegal, and may have NIH funding for their research. Squid cultists offering virgin sacrifice to their tentacled lord, those may be a problem.

### A Note on Cults

Most cults, and other covert threats, tend towards two age brackets- Either

1. They&#39;re young and small and careless, and about to get caught killing a lot of people, or
2. They&#39;re very old because they&#39;re very careful about not getting caught killing people.

It is a matter of debate which is more dangerous; young cults will try to sacrifice the city of Los Angeles to their dark patrons, but old cults will get away with it.

### HAARP

Originally the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program, they manipulate weather. They don&#39;t go in much for subtlety or small-scale operations, having been tied to an attempt to dry up Maricopa County, AZ for a multi-billion dollar ransom and implied to have caused/exacerbated the recent massive floods, but at the same time it&#39;s hard to pick out anything as specifically the result of HAARP manipulation rather than weather just being chaotic. Depending on how cartoonish your game gets, they may or may not be able to command lightning in battle.
Example Plot: HAARP created some major weather disaster currently in the headlines; fix it. HAARP didn&#39;t create some weather problem, but we still ~~need~~ would appreciate their assistance to clean it up.

### Doctor Durden

An anarchist genius who empowers/exploits extremists and discontents. Gives plasma cannons to the Black Panthers, Hyde formulation to the Aryan Nation, and laid-off factory workers pamphlets saying &quot;So You Want To Throw Fireballs&quot;. May be a false flag associated with somebody&#39;s R&amp;D department, using people as test subjects in the search for bigger and better weapons/potions/spells. Or may just be some person(s) who really want to Smash the System. Or maybe both; very few people actually see Durden&#39;s face, after all.
Example Plot: A woman&#39;s studies major emasculated the university president with her bare hands; make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again. Black churches have been hit with a plague of arson attacks, mystifying investigators who don&#39;t know about fireballs.

### Esoteric Order of Dagon

The original fish cult, of which all others are pale imitations. Offering praise, worship, and human sacrifice to their squidly masters in exchange for prosperous fisheries and golden trinkets. Generally a small threat, limited to single cells in isolated villages, but occasionally they get ambitious and try to spread, or offer up the wrong victim, and then the Feds come down like a ton of fish heads.
EG: There&#39;s something odd about this new brand of fish sticks; look into the manufacturer, Innsmouth Fishery Inc. A New England Congressperson suddenly demands massive fishery subsidies; uncover the reasons for this sudden change.

### Majestic 12, AKA MJ12

Formerly a government committee investigating the Roswell incident, which split off and went rogue over differences of opinion with the State Department regarding our brothers from beyond the stars. State was all for opening diplomatic relations with the people who could wipe us from the planet, but MJ12 wanted to PURGE THE XENOS. They still have contacts and support in the government, but mostly funded by reverse-engineering seized alien technology. Often willing to work with agents, either trading in alien junk or providing plausible deniability for anti-alien operations.
EG: A Rigellian diplomat is coming to renegotiate a treaty, keep them from getting killed. The Beast of Betelgeuse has escaped custody, again, and fled to Earth; get him off the planet, preferably alive.

### Initiative Montauk

Descended from a CIA/DARPA program to develop psychic powers for military purposes, when the subjects rebelled and went their own way. They appear to be agents of utter chaos, but might be following some infinitely subtle plan of their leader, who is either a supergenius manipulating their way to global domination, a seer trying to avert impending horror, or a time traveler sent back to prevent his dystopian future. Their deal is manipulating the course of events in unusual, often minor, and extremely specific ways, with no immediately obvious goal.
EG: An unusual series of deaths and discharges at a major firm or school system suggest infiltration, possibly by Montauk; find out who/what they&#39;re after. A biotech startup has unnatural success; it turns out to be Montauk assisting the man who will eventually cure cancer.

### Red Force

Not an actual conspiracy, but a category of threats that gets combined into a disorganized movement. The government has a lot of people who spend a lot of time looking for ways to destroy America, and ways to prevent that destruction. For the most part it&#39;s just models and simulations, but some people go a step too far. They&#39;ll obsess about making people see the threat, or finding even more holes in our nation&#39;s security, even if that means actually exploiting those weaknesses in something indistinguishable from the terrorist attack they&#39;re trying to prevent. Dangerous because, well, they&#39;re experts who know better than anybody else how to wreck our country and are unreasonably determined to follow through on it.
EG: A medical expert whose concerns about vulnerability to biowarfare have fallen on deaf ears decides to stage a zombie plague to make people take it seriously. An SF operative who&#39;s seen the ultramundane side of things is building up a cult and infiltrating a nuclear base.

### Hegemonizing Groups

Again, not a conspiracy, but a category of threats that will make the world like them, through force. The classic example is an all-consuming plague, like zombies, but it can also include brain-washing, madmen with cloning vats, or infectious ideas. The only really good cure is to destroy/capture/cure the entire group, as generally even one specimen is enough to spread the infection. In some lucky cases, you may find a central &quot;Queen&quot; who can control the drones, or is the only one who can convert more drones, though on the other hand, they will almost certainly be well guarded. This may also be used by some other group as a recruiting measure of their own, sweeping people into a group they&#39;ve already suborned.
EG: A political activist has grown weary of persuasion through reasoned argument, and invested in a mind-control device, so now everybody will think correct thoughts. A _supernaturally_ catchy pop tune comes on the scene, teaching kids that EOD is AOK.

### Unethical Researcher

The government, and the few private entities who know about the supernatural, have a healthy number of scientists and research wizards poking into the true nature of the world. Most of these are the sort of helpful boffin you can safely ignore, publishing the occasional well-sanitized paper on their discoveries, or putting together some fascinating new gadget for teleporting potatoes around. Some of them, though, think that they know better than Ethics Committees, and take their investigations a little too far. Think Dr Frankenstein, seeking to cure death itself, and stealing bodies from graveyards to do it. These can be especially hard to deal with, because sometimes their research actually is worth the horror.
Example Plot: Somebody has been snatching homeless people off the streets for presumably horrifying experiments. Citizens who&#39;ve signed up for pharmaceutical trials are going mad, or mutating, or have gained magic powers.

### Powers In Their Own Right

There are &quot;people&quot;, for want of a better word, strong enough that we cannot ignore them, nor can we fight them, we can only try and maintain cordial relations with them. Some are easygoing, wanting nothing more than to see the sights and hunt the game, some are touchy about the respect they feel due a near-deity who has seen the rise and fall of empires, and some are aloof except when they&#39;re demanding. Really, they&#39;re just like any human with the power to scour cities to bedrock.
EG: Thor has decided to grace your local hunting grounds, so you&#39;re on chaperone duty. A dragon living in the Catskills is angry about road development nearby; calm them and fix the road before half of New York goes up in flames.

### Miscellaneous Sketchy Shit

People doing crazy shit behind the scenes. Suitable for one-shots. Steal liberally from Unknown Armies, weird rumors threads, and current events.

- Did you know WD-40 isn&#39;t patented, because doing so would require revealing the secret formula? (Actually true) That&#39;s because their secret formula includes human sacrifice. (Probably not true, but you&#39;ll investigate either way)
- A payphone in the middle of a Tennessee forest has been taking an unusually high number of calls. WTF is going on there?
- Somebody is selling (what he claims to be) sasquatch feet; if they&#39;re not lying, they&#39;re involved in some spooky shit, so tell them to knock it off.
- A military exercise is just a cover for raids on cultists and disrupting ritual sites. You&#39;re riding along with/preparing for one of those operations.
- One of your superiors received a call from a town called Night Vale, a town for which the Census has no record, complaining about their bloodstone circles being non-functional. Find out what&#39;s going on and, I suppose, get their bloodstone circles functioning again.
- If these aren&#39;t enough, you can create a new plot by taking some recent/notable event or group, and adding &quot;Their true purpose is unknown, and thought to be sinister.&quot; IE, &quot;The metal or plastic tips on shoelaces are known as aglets. Their true purpose is sinister.&quot; Or &quot;The Girl Scouts of America. Their true purpose is unknown, and thought to be sinister.&quot;
- Alternatively: Everything in the Weekly World News was real. Find and tag Bat Boy, help former President Bill Clinton negotiate a peace treaty with the Sasquatch, the Garden of Eden has been found in Washington&#39;s Olympic Peninsula, whatever you like.
