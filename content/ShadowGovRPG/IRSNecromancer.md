**Moves**

Start with three moves

**Unquiet Dead**

You can summon a dead person’s shade, either where they died or from their
corpse, and ask them questions. Roll +PR; on a 10+ they answer clearly and
honestly, on a 7-9 they either give a vague answer *or* request a favor in
exchange, and on a 6- both or no answer.

**Blood Bond**

Given a sample of a target’s blood, skin, hair, whatever flesh you can get, you
can use it as a compass to track them. Additionally, you can use Forensic
Analysis as though you were standing in the target’s place.

**Man Saturday**

You have a familiar, permanently bound to your service. Choose what variety:
Hulking **combat** zombie (+1 fight/armor), spirit bound to skull for
**research** assistant (+1 on Thorough Briefing rolls), or Man Saturday
**gofer**.

**Answers From Beyond the Veil**

You gain the *insight* move, and get +1 on any Thorough Briefing regarding
death, and creatures and customs thereof.

**Your Debt Remains Unpaid**

You can raise zombies, once per session. Roll +PR; on a 7+ you get a gang
(small, +2 harm), though GM’s discretion may increase that. On a 7-9, they will
also require some payment beyond laying them to peace afterwards.

**Vampire Touch**

You can drain life force with a touch. Roll +PR; on a 10+ you deal 2 harm to
them and heal 2 harm to yourself, on a 7-9 you drain only 1 harm or are in a bad
position, on a 6- either nothing or both. If the target is restrained,
unconscious, or otherwise unable to resist, you can treat this as an automatic
10+.
